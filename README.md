# role-based-ad-healthcare-lab
Beginner-friendly Active Directory healthcare lab with PowerShell automation
This project involved building a Windows Server 2022 Active Directory domain from scratch in VirtualBox to simulate a role-based healthcare environment. The domain (healthcare.local) was configured with a dedicated domain controller, structured Organizational Units aligned to departments, Group Policies applied at the OU level, and automated user provisioning using PowerShell. During configuration, several common beginner issues were encountered and resolved, including difficulty locating and configuring IPv4 settings, identifying the correct method to promote the server to a domain controller, mistakenly placing users and OUs inside the Domain Controllers container, and understanding the difference between moving users versus assigning group membership for administrative access. Additional troubleshooting included correcting OU placement when Group Policies failed to apply due to users being in the wrong location. These issues were resolved through proper OU design, group membership management, and policy linkage, reinforcing core Active Directory concepts such as OU hierarchy, GPO scope, and best-practice domain administration
